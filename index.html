        <h1>Imagine</h1>
        <div class="author">Lyrics by: John Lennon</div>
        <p>Imagine there's no heaven<br>
            It's easy if you try<br>
            No hell below us<br>
            Above us only sky<br>
            Imagine all the people living for today</p>
        <p>Imagine there's no countries<br>
            It isn't hard to do<br>
            Nothing to kill or die for<br>
            And no religion too<br>
            Imagine all the people living life in peace, you</p>
        <p>You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
            But I'm not the only one<br>
            I hope some day you'll join us<br>
            And the world will be as one</p>
        <p>Imagine no possessions<br>
            I wonder if you can<br>
            No need for greed or hunger<br>
            A brotherhood of man<br>
            Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you</p>
        <p>You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
            But I'm not the only one<br>
            I hope some day you'll join us<br>
            And the world will be as one</p>
